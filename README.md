# CART Technical Vocabulary

## Who is this Page For?

Primarily, this page is for the people providing the captioning, I.E.
the stenographers that create the transcriptions/captions.  However, it
may be useful if you are contracting a CART vendor for an event or
interview, as you may want to refer to this to help your CART
professional understand terminology they may encounter, which will
ensure higher quality captions. Likewise, it may be useful to people who
benefit from CART, to provide to your providers, to obtain better
quality captioning.

## What is CART?

CART is Communication Access Realtime Translation. This is a service
provided by specialized people to provide real-time captions to those
who may benefit from those captions.  You can find out [more
here](https://mn.gov/deaf-hard-of-hearing/communication-access/cart/).

## Purpose

Communities (professional or otherwise) often use specialized
vocabulary.  Many of these terms are likely unfamiliar to
captioning professionals, court reporters, and others who may prefer
to know terminology in advance of captioning/transcription jobs.

Often, however, if a captioner asks an person, "What vocabulary will
you use?" many words may be left out.  This is to help provide a
starting point for those discussions.

## How This Guide Works

This guide is divided by general domain, with each domain having their
own pages. Some terms may be common across multiple domains, and seen
on multiple pages.  Multiple domains may be relevant to a given
captioning task, but likely not all will (should this guide expand).

## Domains

## How to Contribute

Preferred method is via a pull request.  Feel free to contribute new
domains or update ones that are already there.  However, also feel free
to email me (`jmaslak@antelope.net`) suggestions, along with whether or
not you would like to be credited.

Just create a new Markdown page for your vocabulary and submit it as a
PR, to contribute.  Use the [Network Engineering Vocabulary](Network-Engnieering.md)
as an example for the format of how additional vocabulary pages should be
created.  I may ask you to reformat if your format significantly differs.
