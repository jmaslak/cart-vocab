# Network Engineering Vocabulary

## How This Guide Works

Each word/acronym will be presented with the pronunciation, if not
obvious, in parenthesis.  It will be followed by some
contextual/definitional information.

Note that other domains may be relevant to network engineering
discussions.  You can get a list of completed domains under the [Main
Page](README.md) of this repository.

## Sub-domains

There are multiple sub-domains of networking, and it may be beneficial to
ask the person or event you are captioning for what domains are
relevant or which terms from the following lists may come up.

### General Networking

 * Ethernet: a type of network connection
 * LAN (rhymes with Dan): Local Area Network
 * Route/router/routing: Means of or devices that move packets around the network
 * Megabits/Gigabits/Terabits: Network engineers almost always talk
   about bits, not bytes, unlike most IT professionals.
 * Megs/Gigs: Short for megabits/gigabits (usually in networking, it's
   bits, not bytes)
 * WAN (rhymes with Dan): Wide Area Network

### Network Processes / Operations

 * BOM (bahm): Bill of Materials

 * IXP (spelled): Internet Exchange Point
 * MPLS (spelled): Multiprotocol label switching
 * Multicast: one to many
 * NNI (spelled): Network-to-Network Interconnect
 * Packet: a chunk of data sent over a network
 * PE (spelled): Provider Edge
 * Peer: A partner connected to our network
 * PNI (spelled): Private Network Interconnect
 * QoE (spelled): Quality of Experience
 * QoS (spelled): Quality of Service
 * RR (spelled): Route Reflector
 * Service class: Type of packet marking
 * Sflow (ess-flow): A type of network accounting record
 * SSH (spelled): Secure Shell
 * Spanning tree: A networking protocol
 * TC (spelled): Traffic Class
 * TE (spelled): Traffic Engineering
 * Transit: Means of reaching the rest of the internet
 * Unicast: One-to-one communication
