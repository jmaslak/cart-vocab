# Network Engineering Vocabulary

## How This Guide Works

Each word/acronym will be presented with the pronunciation, if not
obvious, in parenthesis.  It will be followed by some
contextual/definitional information.

Note that other domains may be relevant to network engineering
discussions.  You can get a list of completed domains under the [Main
Page](README.md) of this repository.

## Sub-domains

There are multiple sub-domains of networking, and it may be beneficial to
ask the person or event you are captioning for what domains are
relevant or which terms from the following lists may come up.
